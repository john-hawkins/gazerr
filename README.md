# Gaze Duration Error

Gazerr is an application for estimating the expected error in a gaze duration
measurement derived from repeated application of a point of gaze model.

The method requires an input dataset of validation points from the point
of gaze predictive model. This data is used to generate the probability 
distribution of true gaze durations given a measured gaze duration.

### Usage

```
gazerr <CALIBRATION FILE> <SESSION LENGTH> <TRUE GAZE DURATION>
```
