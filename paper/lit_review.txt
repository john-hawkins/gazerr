compares them with manufacturer error bounds. The authors find that the error 
for audult subjects is generally within bounds, but for children and especially
toddlers the error rates tend to be much higher \cite{Dalrymple2018}.



The errors of eye tracking data technology can be decomposed into a range of
independent sources that researchers need to consider \cite{Holmqvist2012}. 
Unless they are properly address these sources of error can manifest themselves
as systematic biases across undesirable dimensions such as the age\cite{Dalrymple2018} 
or ethnicity of subjects\cite{{Blignaut2013}.

The use of eye fixation models to estimate gaze duration (or dwell time) in Area of
Interest studies (AOI) was discussed by Holmqvist et al. \cite{Holmqvist2012}. The
authors simulated the impact of gaze fixation error by adding noise accoridng to
manufacturer specifications to data sets of low margin areas of interest. We extend 
this idea to calculate probabilistic bounds on the error in gaze duration using
calibration data as a source of noise distribution that is specific to both the
study participants and the device/environment of the study. The result is an open
source application that may be used by a wide variety of reserachers to provide
error bounds on any gaze duration measurements.
